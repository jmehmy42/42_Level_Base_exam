# Rank 02 Test â€“ 42_Level_Base_exam

This repository contains the test for Rank 02 in the 42 Level Base exam.

## How to Use

1. **Run the Program:**  
   When you execute the program, it will automatically create two folders:
   - `rendu`
   - `subject`

2. **Subject File Creation:**  
   Inside the `subject` folder, a C file named `subject.c` will be created.

3. **Write Your Code:**  
   Open the `subject/subject.c` file and write your solution code to the given problem.

4. **Run the Test:**  
   After writing your code, simply run the test to check your solution.

## Workflow

- The test script manages all folder and file creation for you.
- You only need to focus on writing your code in `subject/subject.c`.
- The test system will compile and run your code, and automatically check the results.

## Example

```sh
# Run the program (example)
bash exampractice.sh  

# Edit your solution
vim subject/subject.c

# Check your work
type test
```

## Notes

- Make sure you have the necessary permissions to create folders/files in your working directory.
- Your code should be written in C and saved in the `subject/subject.c` file.

Good luck on your Rank 02 test!
